# Multi-armed-Bandits-Approach-for-Recommendations-Systems

## Project Overview

This project implements the Multi-armed Bandits algorithm to optimize recommendations in systems with uncertainty. The method aims to balance exploration of new items and exploitation of known rewarding items, dynamically adapting to user interactions and feedback.

## Description

Recommendation systems often face the challenge of recommending the most relevant items to users without prior knowledge of user preferences. The Multi-armed Bandits (MAB) approach effectively addresses this by iteratively learning and improving recommendations based on user responses. This implementation specifically utilizes the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, balancing exploration and exploitation efficiently.

## Features

- Dynamic recommendation generation based on real-time user interactions.
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for optimal balance between exploring new items and exploiting known popular items.
- Performance metrics to evaluate recommendation effectiveness.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>


Install required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

- Run the script using:

python Multi-armed_Bandits_Approach_for_Recommendations_Systems.py

- The script will generate dynamic recommendations and output performance metrics.

Results

The implementation provides visual insights into the performance of recommendations through plotted graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MAB-UCB strategy.

FutureImprovements

- Integration with more complex datasets and real-world scenarios.

- Implementation of alternative MAB algorithms (Thompson Sampling, Epsilon-Greedy).

- Expanding performance metrics for a deeper analytical perspective.
